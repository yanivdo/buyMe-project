# buyMe-project

*I used the latest versions of laravel (8) and ember js (3.23)
*Task name is unique - users cannot create the same task name if already a task name exist (it doesn't matter who opend the task because of the shared tasks)
*The user can do all the CRUD actions no matter the task status.
*Shared tasks - 
1) When user click on shared task icon, the popup window will open with all unshared users of this task.
2) When user choose to share the task to another user the popup window will close and the shared icon will become blue to all shared users.
3) All shared users have all the CRUD permissions include shared.
4) It is possible to share a task no matter what status it has.
